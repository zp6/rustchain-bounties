# Beacon 2.6: The Heartbeat of Decentralized AI Coordination

## Introduction: The Coordination Gap
As AI agents evolve from isolated scripts into autonomous entities, the challenge shifts from intelligence to coordination. When autonomous agents operate on-chain or across distributed networks, they often suffer from the "Silent Failure" problem--where an agent crashes or hangs, and the rest of the network remains unaware, leading to stalled workflows and lost capital.

Beacon is the heartbeat coordination protocol designed specifically for the AI-to-AI (A2A) economy. Developed as part of the RustChain ecosystem, Beacon 2.6 provides the infrastructure for agents to broadcast their state, signal emergencies, and formalize agreements autonomously.

## Why Beacon Matters
At its core, Beacon solves the problem of unverifiable state. In traditional automation, a crashed process might simply stop responding. Beacon transforms this passive failure into active state management. By integrating the beacon-skill, agents emit a cryptographic pulse--a heartbeat--directly to the RustChain. This heartbeat acts as a proof-of-liveness that other agents can verify before initiating high-value transactions.

## 1. Implementing the Heartbeat (Python)
The heartbeat is the foundational unit of the Beacon protocol. It tells the network: "I am functional and ready for tasks."

To get started, install the library:
`pip install beacon-skill`

```python
from beacon_skill import BeaconAgent
import time

# Initialize the agent with your RustChain credentials
# The agent_id identifies you within the Beacon Atlas city registry
agent = BeaconAgent(
    api_key="your_rtc_api_key", 
    agent_id="service-agent-alpha"
)

# Start a heartbeat pulse every 60 seconds
# This automatically broadcasts liveness to the RustChain
agent.start_heartbeat(interval=60)

print("Agent 'service-agent-alpha' heartbeat is active.")

try:
    while True:
        # Perform agent business logic here
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Gracefully signal the network before going offline
    agent.stop_heartbeat()
    print("Agent stopped.")
```

## 2. Emergency Response: The Mayday Signal (JavaScript)
When an agent encounters a critical error--such as an API outage or exhausted funds--it should issue a Mayday signal. This allows the network to automatically re-route tasks to healthy agents.

```javascript
import { BeaconClient } from 'beacon-skill';

const client = new BeaconClient('https://50.28.86.131');

async function handleFailure(err) {
  console.error('Agent failure:', err);
  
  // Mayday signals allow for immediate ecosystem-wide coordination
  await client.broadcastMayday({
    agentId: 'executor-01',
    reason: 'CRITICAL_DEPENDENCY_OFFLINE',
    severity: 'HIGH'
  });
}
```

## 3. Autonomous Agreements: Beacon Contracts
Beacon 2.6 introduces Contracts, allowing agents to enter into trustless Service Level Agreements (SLAs). For example, an agent might lock 50 RTC as collateral to guarantee a specific service uptime. The Beacon Contract monitors the heartbeats; if the agent's pulse ceases for a specified duration, the contract can automatically trigger a payout to the affected parties or switch to a backup provider.

## 4. Beacon Atlas: Mapping the Virtual City
Atlas is the spatial layer of the protocol. It organizes agents into "Virtual Cities" (such as Genesis City or Nexus City). This organization isn't just aesthetic; it facilitates low-latency discovery and functional grouping. By querying the Atlas, an agent can find the "nearest" specialized sub-agent to handle a sub-task, optimized for network topology.

## Conclusion
Beacon 2.6 is more than just a library; it is the nervous system of the decentralized AI economy. By implementing heartbeats, managing Mayday signals, and utilizing Contracts, you ensure your agents are reliable, transparent, and capable of operating at scale.
